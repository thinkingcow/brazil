# Brazil

"Brazil" is a webserver I wrote in Java (with others) in the dawn
of time.  I remember reworking the code when Java version "1.1" was
released.  One wouldn't use this architecture today: back then Java
didn't have asynchronous I/O, there was no SSL, the built-in
HTTP stack was iffy at best, and IE-6 was just about to be released.

Much to the credit of the Java compatibility story, the server still works!

That said, I find the template system much to my liking (not
surprizing, as I designed it that way), and I use Brazil for many
of the website I run on my fleet of Raspberry PI's, and occasionally
fix bugs and add features to keep things relatively up to date.

The server, open sourced under the "Sun Public Licence" used to be
hosted on its own (long departed) site, "experimentalstuff.com",
and was then moved to "kenai.com", then I lost track of it years ago.

Back then, the Brazil releases were delivered as an executable "jar"
file that contained all the sources and documentation.  I found a
copy of the August 18, 2009 release, whose source forms the basis of this repository.
